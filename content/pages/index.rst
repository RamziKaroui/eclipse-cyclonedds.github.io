Building Portable & Interoperable Distributed Datacentric Systems
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Cyclone DDS is a high performing, OMG-DDS standard based data sharing technology which allows system designers to create digital twines of their systems’ entities to share their states, events, data-streams and messages on the network in real-time and fault-tolerant way

Highlights

Fast & Dependable
-----------------

Cyclone DDS has an extremely low latency and high throughput, especially in rush environments and noisy networks where error transmission rates are relatively high.​
Performance variability and jitters are minimum which make it suitable for real-time and mission critical applications.​
Cyclone also has a low footprint making it suitable for both enterprise and embedded systems.​

Capitalizing on our lengthy experience developing data-centric middleware in real-time distributed systems,​
the Cyclone DDS development team and community are fulfilling stringent software development processes with certifiability of the technology mind to be deployed where safety is mandated.​

Consistent & Scalable
---------------------

Cyclone minimizes the DDS automatic discovery protocol overhead by aggregating the number of applications' representatives in the DDS network.​
It scales out, both in Edge based peer-to-peer or in large-scale IoT deployments.​
To rationalize the network resources in use, it can spread data on different multicast and unicast groups to confine it physically to where it is needed.​

The Cyclone design maintains data distribution integrity and consistency between all applications that need it.​
Data consistency is guaranteed, even when the system topology changes due to application disconnections and reconnections or, transient infrastructure failure.​

Secure & Interoperable
----------------------

To secure data exchanges, pre-built or user-defined plug-ins for applications Authentication, Authorization and data Encryption are supported.​
Authentication uses the pre-built plugins with RSA, key exchange uses Diffie-Hellman.​ Authorization uses a permissions document signed by shared Certificate Authority.​ Cryptography uses AES-GCM and AES-GMAC for message authentication.​

As a smart implementation of the DDSi-RTPS and the DDS-Security protocols Cyclone DDS interoperates with any other DDS vendor compliant implementation.​
Interworking with non-DDS technologies is possible through other mediating technologies such as Zenoh or Camel-Apache.​
